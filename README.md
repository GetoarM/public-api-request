# public-api-request

For this project, I'll build an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world.
They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

I’ll use the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data to build a prototype
for an Awesome Startup employee directory.

# Style Modifications
